# KSS Scoring Guidelines

## Overview
You will be scoring images of people's upper bodies for sleepiness/drowsiness using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) along with a written explanation of your reasoning.

## KSS Scale (1-9)

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Very alert | Feeling active, vital, alert, or wide awake |
| 2 | Alert | Functioning at high levels, but not at peak; able to concentrate |
| 3 | Neither alert nor sleepy | Awake, but relaxed; responsive but not fully alert |
| 4 | Rather alert | Somewhat fresh |
| 5 | Neither alert nor sleepy | Foggy; losing interest in remaining awake; slowed down |
| 6 | Some signs of sleepiness | Sleepy, woozy, fighting sleep; prefer to lie down |
| 7 | Sleepy, but no effort to keep awake | No longer fighting sleep; drifting into sleep onset; lost some ability to remain awake |
| 8 | Sleepy, some effort to keep awake | Asleep, but can be awakened without difficulty |
| 9 | Very sleepy, great effort to keep awake | Very difficult to stay awake |

## What to Look For

### Physical Indicators:
- **Eyes**: Droopy eyelids, frequent blinking, partially closed eyes, unfocused gaze
- **Head position**: Head tilting, nodding, lack of upright posture
- **Facial expression**: Slack facial muscles, yawning, blank expression
- **Body posture**: Slouching, leaning, loss of postural control

### Behavioral Cues:
- **Alertness level**: How engaged/aware the person appears
- **Muscle tension**: Relaxed vs. tense facial and neck muscles
- **Attention**: Whether eyes appear focused or unfocused

## Explanation Requirements

**For each score, provide a 1-2 sentence explanation covering:**

1. **What you observed** - Specific physical indicators you noticed
2. **Why you chose that score** - Your reasoning for the numerical rating

### Good Explanation Examples:

**Score 3 + Explanation**: *"The person appears relaxed with normal eye opening and upright posture, but their facial expression seems neutral and somewhat unfocused, suggesting a calm but not fully alert state."*

**Score 7 + Explanation**: *"Eyes are noticeably droopy with heavy eyelids, and the head is slightly tilted to one side, indicating clear signs of sleepiness with some struggle to remain awake."*

**Score 2 + Explanation**: *"Eyes are wide open and focused, posture is upright and engaged, showing clear alertness though perhaps not at peak energy levels."*

### What NOT to include:
- Assumptions about the person's activities or circumstances
- Judgments about appearance unrelated to sleepiness
- Personal opinions about the person

## Tips for Consistent Scoring

1. **Take your time** - Look at the image for at least 10-15 seconds
2. **Focus on objective observations** - What you can actually see
3. **Use the full scale** - Don't cluster around middle values
4. **Be consistent** - Try to apply the same criteria across all images
5. **When in doubt** - Lean toward the lower score and explain your uncertainty

## Quality Control

- Explanations should be professional and objective
- If you're unsure between two scores, mention this in your explanation
- Use the additional notes field for any concerns or special observations

Remember: Your explanations are as valuable as your numerical scores for research purposes!
